GoController: Privacy-Preserving Token Activity Monitor
Project Overview
GoController is a decentralized application built for Base Layer 2 that provides secure, privacy-preserving monitoring of ERC-20 token activities. By leveraging Nillion's secure computation technology alongside Privy and Coinbase Agent Kit, it enables token creators to monitor activities while maintaining data privacy and security.
